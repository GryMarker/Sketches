Each folder in this repository corresponds to a specific science project. Inside each folder, you'll find the complete Arduino code, 
ready for you to upload to your ESP32 board. These sketches are designed to be a solid foundation for your investigation, allowing you to collect data, 
analyze it, and draw scientific conclusions.

**Getting Started**
To get these projects up and running, you'll need to follow a few simple steps.

Install the Arduino IDE: Download and install the official Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from the Arduino website.

Add ESP32 Board Manager: The Arduino IDE doesn't support the ESP32 out of the box. You need to manually add the ESP32 board manager URL in the preferences.

In the Arduino IDE, go to File > Preferences.

In the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, paste this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json.

Install ESP32 Boards:
Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager....
Search for "esp32" and install the "esp32 by Espressif Systems" package.

Connect and Upload:
Connect your ESP32 board to your computer with a USB cable.
Select your board from Tools > Board (e.g., "DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1").
Select the correct COM port under Tools > Port.
Open the desired project sketch from this repository in the Arduino IDE.
Click the "Upload" button (the right-arrow icon) to send the code to your ESP32.

**We've developed this code to give you a reliable starting point for your projects. 
While these sketches are robust, they are also designed for you to experiment with. 
You are encouraged to modify the code and explore different hardware connections.**

Please remember that any changes you make to the code or the hardware are your responsibility. 
We are not liable for any issues that may arise from these modifications.

We are committed to helping you succeed in your scientific endeavors. If you have any questions, notice any issues, or have a brilliant idea for an improvement, 
please create an issue in this repository.
